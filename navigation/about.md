My name is Kiruthic Selvakumar
I am 15 years old 
I play tennis and karate. I have been practicing karate for 5 years, and I am currently a brown belt working toward my black belt. Tennis is something I have started recently, and I find it very fun and continue to play the sport in my free time. In school, I enjoy doing math because I find solving problems is really interesting. Outside of school, some of my hobbies include playing video games on my PS5 and spending time with family and friends. I am also very fascinated by technology, and interested to continue coding in this class.
