<br>
My name is Kiruthic Selvakumar,
and I am 15 years old.
I play tennis and karate. I have been practicing karate 🥋 for 5 years, and I am currently a brown belt working toward my black belt. Tennis 🎾 is something I have started recently, and I find it very fun and continue to play the sport in my free time. In school, I enjoy doing math 📐📏 because I find solving problems is really interesting. Outside of school, some of my hobbies include playing video games 🎮 on my playstation and spending time with family and friends. I am also very fascinated by technology👨‍💻, and interested to continue coding in this class.

My family consists of my mom 🤱, dad👨‍🍼, and older sister. I was born in San Diego and have lived here my entire life. I went to Monterey Ridge Elementary School, Oak Valley Middle School, and now am a sophmore at Del Norte 🏫. 👍
