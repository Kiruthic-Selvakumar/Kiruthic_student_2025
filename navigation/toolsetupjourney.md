Setting up tools was an interesting process for me because there was problems along the way, but at the end everything worked out. I used a mac by the way.
<h3>Downloading</h3>
<body>The process of downloading most of the necessary tools was not too complicated. I simply followed the directions, and I had issues with admin access on the computer, so make sure you have admin privileges on your computer, or have someone with admin helping you because you will need their passwords when downloading certaint tools.</body>
<h3>Checking Versions</h3>
<body>This is where the problems began. When I was running my checks to check the version of juypter, I seemed to not have certain tools I needed like notebook, but I quickly found out that I needed to go visual studio code extensions and make sure I downloaded the Jupyter extension, which installed everything I need. The problem was resolved. Another problem I ran into was my version of Ruby which was 2.6, but we needed at least 3. However I tried multiple ways to update it, but nothing seemed to work out and I made the decision that this version was capable enough for now, since it is not too old of a version.</body>
<h3>Make File</h3>
<body>After my success with running the checks, I thought that the rest of the job was easy. However I kept encountering an error when using the make command. I tried asking multiple people and thats when a peer helped me out because I had forgotten to use the source venv/bin/activate command. This solved my problem and the make command worked allowing me to create this website page.</body>
<h3>Overall Suggestions</h3>
<body>The setup process was not as smooth as expected, but with some trouble shooting it worked out. Although, I did feel that during the setup process we were mostly just told to follow strict steps, but sometimes it was not clear or explained why we were doing it. For example when we had to clone the repository, I was initially confused on how and why we were doing this, but with the use of resources such as peers and the internet I was able to familiarize myself to using github and vscode in harmony to create our very own Nighthawk Page website. This opens up possibilities for many other coding oppurtunities. Remember to make sure to not give up, although the setup process can be quite challenging at times.</body>
