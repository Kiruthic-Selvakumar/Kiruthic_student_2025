## Final Reflection

Throughout the AP CSP trimester, I maintained consistent daily study habits and completed **every assigned homework** ‚Äî often ahead of schedule. With scores of **0.9 or higher on more than 90%** of submissions, I not only met expectations but exceeded them. This journey has refined my logic, critical thinking, and programming fundamentals, and has prepared me for both the AP exam and future computer science pursuits.

## Homework Reflection Blog

Over the course of this trimester, the homework assignments were more than just boxes to check off ‚Äî they were essential stepping stones that helped me build a strong foundation in computer science principles.

Each task challenged a different skill. For example:

-  **Digital Divide** and **Computing Bias** taught me that computing isn't just code ‚Äî it's about equity, ethics, and understanding real-world impact.
-  **Binary Search** and **Big O Notation** revealed the elegance of efficient thinking, helping me recognize patterns and apply logic to optimize performance.
- **Safe Computing** and **Legal/Ethical Concerns** pushed me to think critically about privacy and responsibility in an increasingly connected world.
-  Lessons like **Binary**, **Logic Gates**, and **Base64 Encoding** gave me a peek under the hood ‚Äî into how machines think and communicate at a microscopic level.
-  **Simulations** and **Randomness** showed me how computing models can mirror real-world systems, from predicting disease spread to running online games.

But most importantly, this homework experience helped me:

- Develop a daily study routine.
- Break down complex ideas into approachable steps.
- See how math, logic, and ethics all intersect in computer science.
- Reflect and document my learning consistently and visually.

Completing all these homeworks on time and receiving high marks on most wasn‚Äôt just about grades ‚Äî it was about building mastery, resilience, and a mindset of curiosity.

This consistent effort was also proof that even the most technical topics can become intuitive when you learn actively, ask questions, and build things yourself.

With all lessons reviewed, all homeworks complete, and every concept internalized ‚Äî I‚Äôm proud to say that I didn‚Äôt just survive AP CSP, I fully engaged with it.

**Onward to more coding, deeper thinking, and better building. üöÄ**
