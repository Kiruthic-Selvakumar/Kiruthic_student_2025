## Overview

Flocker turns hot takes into structured debates. Users spark discussions on questions like “Does pineapple belong on pizza?” then post, reply, and switch topics—powered by a full-stack system with real-time features.

### How It Works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Pick a debate topic |
| 2 | Post your argument |
| 3 | Reply to others in threads |
| 4 | Navigate between debates with the sidebar |
