# "Real World" Projects

**Don't do it alone.** You and your pair will work collaboratively together and will learn to Build, Deploy and Host a Website (many blogs).  Each blog has "Technicals" learned throughout each project.  This Website will be done as incremental blogs as you learn.  Each week an assignment will be given, and then the next week it will be under **Live Review**, and then for the weeks after each blog will be hosted on your Website.
