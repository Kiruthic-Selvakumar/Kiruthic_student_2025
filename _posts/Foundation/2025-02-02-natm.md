# Reflection

Night at the Museum was a great oppurtunity for us because we were able to get feedback from other parents and students, simulating real user feedback. They gave us feedback and tips to improve both our presentation skills, our features, and also asked us some insightful questions.

I reviewed, left feedback, and listened to the presentation of several other groups at Night at the Museum, including 1 CSA group, 1 CSSE project, and several CSP groups

We presented our feature to several people and highlighted our main goal and features with a live demo. In addition we offered a computer where they could interact with and try out the features for themselves, as well as qr codes to leave comments and give feedback.
