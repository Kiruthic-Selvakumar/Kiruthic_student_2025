# Reflection

The student panel gave me some really useful advice that I can definitely apply to both CSP and life in general. I realized how important it is to be clear with things like flowcharts and UML diagrams, so I can communicate my ideas better whether it’s in code or discussions. The tips on staying organized with Agile and working through real-world projects reminded me that consistency and collaboration are key to making progress. Overall, I’m feeling more motivated to dive into STEM, make the most of opportunities like dual enrollment, and build my network through LinkedIn and coding communities.



# Takeaways & Notes

Tt is important to make clear diagrams in developing an idea with flowcharts & UML: 

One student did an internship that focuses on speaking skills and live reviews in CSP and CSA helped them

A student spoke about the need for effective speaking skills both in technical discussions.

Project-Based learning helped them focus on learning through the completion of real-world projects.

Worked in an Agile environment, using iterative improvements.

GitHub Skills: Gained experience using GitHub for collaboration.

One student used Dijkstra's Algorithm to develop cool projects and used this algorithm for shortest path problems.

The full-stack development they learned in this class helped them gain experience in both frontend and backend development.

It is important to avoid procrastination and stay on track and avoiding delays in project work and using AGILE methodology and making consistent efforts and commits everyday.

They enncouraged researching specific programs and offerings when selecting a college major and especially applying to oppurtunities in high school to gain a better understanding of our interests.

Some suggested taking advantage of community college dual enrollment credits to complete courses faster and learn more.
