## What I learned
Even though I feel confident in many math and logic based problems/questions anyone can make mistakes so it is important to slow down, validate my answers, double check if I have time, and use process of elimination to ensure my answer is 100% correct. In addition, although I still don't know too much about how audio information is stored when compared to pictures which I have more knowledge on (RGB), I understood the fundamental concept that was being teste which was that no matter what infomration is being stored in a computer, at the lowest level that will be in binary and bits, and that is essential to know when answering questions regardless if the information is a string, integer, photo, video, or audio.

## My Strengths
This Practice Multiple Choice Exam was good preparation and it was expected because of the MCQs we have done before. I feel extremely confident with the logic based problems about algorithms and how the code would be executed. I feel like I am good at being able to understand the logic behind the progrem including booleans, and sequencing, and I feel that being able to quickly grasp the code is my strength. In addition, compared the the perivous 2 MCQs I felt much more confident on the topics regarding theory such as beneficial and harmful effects(which were pretty obvious already), but more so in crowdsourcing, heuristic algorithms, citizen scienc, etc. due to the various in class team teaches especially on Big ideas 1 and 3. In addition I feel much more confident about my knowledge of the internet, with IP addresses and how information is stored and sent, which I was only half sure about last MCQ.
## What I feel weak on:
By analyzing the question I got wrong, it was obvious to me that 1 of the quesitons I got wrong was because I truly didn't know the theory or information to answer it due to a lack of exposure in the field, and 2 of my incorrect answers were more logic based and binary which I normally perform well on, but made a mistake when going quickly. In specifics the question I struggled on was a question about how audio is stored, because it confused me, but I gained insight now. Even though I got most intenret questions right through my learnings, common knowledge, and smart test taking strategies, I sometimes struggled on speciifc questions relating to how information was transfered through packets that are split up, etc. so I will review those questions even though I got them right.


## Corrections:

I got this question incorrect because I did not spend enough time looking into the logic. I read the second to last line and got the value of second correctly, however I did not notice that after that first was assigned the value of second so first and second have the same value of 100, simply an ignorant mistake that I now understand, and understand to spend more time completely reading the question.

This is the question that I think I truly got wrong through a lack of knowledge of the content because I failed to acknowledge that regardless of the type of datat that is being stored all data including audio at the lowest level will be stored in binary bits. i should try to focus more on these key concepts and underlying ideas rather than getting confused or caught up by new vocabulary like "analog audio".

In this question I was supposed to pick the smallest amount of binary digits that can represent something at least 100 digits in size. So 2 to the power of 7 is 128 which is greater than 100, while 2 to the power of 6 is 64, so we need at least 7 binary bits to be able to store the data.
