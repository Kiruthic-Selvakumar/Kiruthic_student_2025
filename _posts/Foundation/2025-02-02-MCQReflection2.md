## What I learned:
This Practice Multiple Choice Exam was similar to the one we have done before, and that gave me experience and exposure to the type of questions. It required a lot of logic, and thinking how exactly each step in each question would change a variable. I had to use my mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills to solve many of the questions. I learned that many questions do not require much textbook knowledge but I have to be very keen on what each line of code means and what it does. So it is important to be observant and understand how each line of code plays out.

## What I feel weak on:
By analyzing the question I got wrong, it was evident to me that I do not have a clear understanding of the Internet Protocol. I think that I can improve on and read about the different requirements and policies involved with sending informaiton over the interent, and I need to better understand what the latest protocols in place do to make sending information securely over the internet efficient.

## Corrections:

I got this question incorrect because I did not know the difference between IPv4 and IPv6. The incorrect answer option that I clicked on was actually not true, because regardless of the length of the address that does not impact or change the routing time of packets, because it is just a number used for location. However what IPv6 does introduce is more addresses for devices to connect to and this allows for more devices on a certain network, than IPv4 did, making it more updated and useful due to hosting more devices.
