# Reflection - Connection to Me
Reflecting on all of this, I realized that cybersecurity isn’t only about knowing technical the technical tools involved in security, but its also about about being able to adapt and collaborate with a passion. It’s clear that building strong communication and people skills is just as important as staying informed on threats and technology. This has shown me that anyone with the right mindset and passion can find a meaningful place in the cybersecurity world, and cybersecurity is a cool way to channel your interests because as the world is growing in technology, it is becoming more and more important to secure our information.


# Why Cybersecurity Is Important
Cybersecurity protects personal data, keeps privacy, and guards against threats in the digital world. It's a constantly changing field that affects every aspect of life.

  <li>Make sure not to click on fishy links</li>
  <li>People in China steal billions of dollars worth of intellectual property</li>
  <li>Security became more popular in the 90’s</li>
  <li>It is important to be able to communicate your technical understanding and ideas to a presentable level and dumb it down to present it to leaders to explain the major advantages it brings, especially in the business way</li>
  <li>It is important to take what you know and articulate it in a way business owners can understand</li>
  <li>It is important to be observant and not ignorant</li>

It is important to stay informed and be at the top of the game, especially doing research and staying aware of what other countries are doing. Check what new vulnerabilities are on the rise, and new unknowns, making sure to dig in as much as you can because of the constant changes in the field</li>
  <li>Massive amounts of reading are required to be able to adjust to the change of the job</li>

# Types of Attacks
Cyber threats come in a lot of forms, and understanding them is crucial for defense. Attack types change constantly and can have large-scale impact.

<ul>
  <li>0-days cyber</li>
  <li>Usually it is very labor intensive for a 0-day, and huge campaigns will spread if it’s a practical novel approach, for the pipeline</li>
